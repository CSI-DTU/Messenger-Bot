<pattern>WHAT SETS CSI APART</pattern>
<template>College life is synonymous with zeal, passion, enthusiasm and excitement. And that is what sets CSI apart from the other cliched 
technical societies. We don't conduct boring meetings, we don't organise boring events, and dull is one word you'd never associate 
with us. Because CSI does everything with elan and exuberance. With our well-thought line up of engaging and entertaining events, 
months are different in college. Too much happens!

<pattern>MORE ABOUT IDG</pattern>
<template>IDGs are one of the major aspects of a tech society.They are about learning from seniors and exploring your field of interest and surely you all would have taken most out of it.
Now, its the time to showcase the acquired skills.Its your opportunity of helping out your peers and direct their enthusiasm into something productive.
Also ,to teach is to learn twice over.
Witness your knowledge growing up to next level, along the way, as you get exposure, experience and exercise out your brains in solving out the doubts.
"Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach."
