>>>WHAT SETS CSI APART
College life is synonymous with zeal, passion, enthusiasm and excitement. And that is what sets CSI apart from the other cliched 
technical societies. We don't conduct boring meetings, we don't organise boring events, and dull is one word you'd never associate 
with us. Because CSI does everything with elan and exuberance. With our well-thought line up of engaging and entertaining events, 
months are different in college. Too much happens.
